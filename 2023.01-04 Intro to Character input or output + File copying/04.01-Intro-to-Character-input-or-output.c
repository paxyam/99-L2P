/*
text stream - sequence of newline chracacters divided into lines,
each line consists of zero or more characters followed by newline character,
library job
we (the programmer) dont need to worry about how lines look outside the program

#include <stdio.h>
main()
{
    c=getchar()
}


getchar reads the next input character from a text stream 
and returns that as its value
the variable c contains the next character of output

#include <stdio.h>
main()
{
    putchar(c)
}

prints the contents of the integer variable 'c' as a character, 
usually on screen
'putchar' and 'printf' may be interleaved, the output will
appear in the order in which the calls are made
